cmdlineoptions-java
===============

A simple java class handling commandline options.

Currently available just as a Java class, within an eclipse project. :)

It supports single dashed options like "-h", double dashed options "--help" and additional option alternatives.
It has got automatic help handling of all configured options with "-h", "--help" and "-?".


Future plans
===============

- tests, of course...
- refactoring for more flexibility
- better errorhandling
- writing a simple getting started

- writing the exact same thing for:
 - C
 - C++
 - bash?
 - ...
