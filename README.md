cmdlineoptions-java
===============

A simple java class handling commandline options.

Currently available just as a Java class, later i will add some examples and an eclipse project surrounding.

It supports single dashed options like "-h", double dashed options "--help" and additional option alternatives.
It has got automatic help handling of all configured options with "-h", "--help" and "-?".
